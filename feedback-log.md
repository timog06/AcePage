|10.01.2025|Requirements look good! here's a version I was writing before: (Updated Requirements)|Update requirements.md|Complete|None.|
|10.01.2025| i think you understand it exactly the type of layout that would look good|Created first design mockup|Complete|The About section is a nice bonus :iroh_laugh: |
|11.01.2025|This is a bit different that the card/component dashboard design you have the for index, but it was just another idea I had. it may or may not suit|Create a design mockup with hero section.|Complete|Yeah i like both of them, and that Hero layout works really well ðŸ™‚|
|11.01.2025|I think Hero layout for the Index looks good. The dashboard layout might be more suitible for another page with more functions.|Hero Section design chosen.|Complete|None.|
|11.01.2025|I like the SteamID input being on the left side of the main Hero taking up alot of space. it would be nice for this to forward the user to the stats page.|Keep Layout of SteamId, make it forward to stats.html|Complete.|For development.|
|11.01.2025|On the right side I think it should be a 'Join Discord' widget. Getting player to clearly see the discord link would really be a main focus we want users on the home page to see clearly.|Change the Position of the Join Discord button to Hero Section|Complete|For development.|
|11.01.2025|the card components below the Hero look good. these will work well as 'Server Rules' or links to the full rules.|Possibly add a server rules page.|Complete.|For development.|
|12.01.2025|Yeah those layouts look very good! seperate rules look well too.|Showed updated mockup for rules.html and index.html|Complete|None.|
|12.01.2025|fontaswesome has great icons. Definitely a good call to use them for all those area's you mentioned. another lib i recommended looking at is Material UI icons. I'll let you decide whichever you'd like to use.|MUI taken into consideration and learn how to implement it|Complete.|Might have to setup a React project to not bloat website with full MUI Library.|
|17.01.2025|The tasks look perfect. all requirements are spot on.|Showed final requirements.md to client.|Complete|None.|
|17.01.2025|design layouts look good. sections all make sense and we can flesh out more content for them later, but the division of each section will work really well. I would say to make good use of the css grid layout so it can dynamically handle more/less components for a section, this would work well for the group of elements below the Hero on the home page. The 'About' page with team list would be a lower priority.|Wrote down css suggestion to try out and made about page lower priority.|Complete|None.|
|17.01.2025|Colour scheme.... hmmm... we've been playing with the star wars yellow (#FFE81F} as a primary colour, with secondary being a very dark navy/black as the compliment. But this is up for debate if it would work for a complete website. I would recommend tying all the coloured components to global --var's in the main css/scss file so it can be altered for the whole website later if we want to change the colours, but maybe for now the yellow/dark navy combo would be nice. Ideally it follows a 'dark mode' theme.|Wrote down the suggested colors for the website.|Complete.|Looked at SCSS/SASS, doesn't seem that hard but would have to be installed via a React Project.|
|18.01.2025|Fair play mate ðŸ™‚ I'll have a better look in the morning, but first thing i can see is the Hero container needs to be the same width as the card components container below. It looks like the cards have too much padding or margin on the far left and right.|Removed padding for the three columns below the header.|Complete|None|
|19.01.2025|Hey mate, looks great ðŸ™‚ i see a couple of content overflow issues:||Complete||
|19.01.2025|Weekends been busy, but looks like we will need to turn the stats mod into rest api. I'd say carry on with that static data for the stats for now and finish off what else you need to do in the meantime. // might be worth to jump in a call if you're free any evening this week to go through it better and confirm what endpoints that'll work for you.|Create a small list of endpoints that would make sense from the website.|Complete|None.|
|24.01.2025|Yeah it's a good idea. React apps are just better to work on. only drawback is you need to understand JSX aswell as javascript.|Started React project and converted initial components.|Complete|None.|
|31.01.2025|(From Call) "We have our own design we made on Figma if you wanna take a look and even try making it."|Started a second React project based on clientâ€™s own design.|Complete|Ask client to provide API details.|
|31.01.2025|I like that idea. Ideally we could add X amount of users to compare stats with, not just 2|Complete|Ask client for confirmation.|
|04.02.2025|Very cool! Looks fantastic|Completed 2nd react project.|Complete|None|
