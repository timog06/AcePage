|10.01.2025| i think you understand it exactly the type of layout that would look good|Created first design mockup|Complete|The About section is a nice bonus :iroh_laugh: |

|11.01.2025|I think Hero layout for the Index looks good. The dashboard layout might be more suitible for another page with more functions.|Hero Section design chosen.|Complete|None.|
|11.01.2025|I like the SteamID input being on the left side of the main Hero taking up alot of space. it would be nice for this to forward the user to the stats page.|Keep Layout of SteamId, make it forward to stats.html|In Progress.|For development.|

|11.01.2025|the card components below the Hero look good. these will work well as 'Server Rules' or links to the full rules.|Possibly add a server rules page.|In Progress.|For development.|
